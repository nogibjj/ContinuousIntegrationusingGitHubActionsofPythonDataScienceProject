**Summary**

This project demonstrates how to set up Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions for a Python-based Data Science project. This project serves as a reference for setting up Continuous Integration in Data Science projects, ensuring code quality and consistency. 

---
**Project Structure**

- **Jupyter Notebook(src/DescriptiveStats.ipynb)**:
  - Contains cells that perform descriptive statistics using Pandas.
  - Validated using the nbval plugin for pytest.

- **Python Script(src/script_descriptive_stats.py)**:
  - Executes the same descriptive statistics using Pandas.

- **lib.py(src/lib.py)**:
  - Holds shared code used by both the script and the notebook.

- **Makefile**:
  - Contains four commands:
    - Test: Run all tests (notebook, script, and lib)
    - Format: Format code with Python black
    - Lint: Lint code with Ruff
    - Install: Install dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- **test_script.py(tests/test_script_descriptive_stats.py)**:
  - Contains tests for the script.

- **test_lib.py(tests/test_lib.py)**:
  - Includes tests for the library.

- **Pinned requirements.txt**:
  - Specifies exact versions of dependencies.
